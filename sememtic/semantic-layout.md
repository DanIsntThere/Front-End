### notes

1. You may omit the `<header>` and it's decendants if it's only a sole headline and replace it with `<h1>`.
2. In this example the navigation `<nav>` is a page specific navigation, hence **after** the page header `<header>`. If the `<nav>` is a global navigation, it might also be **before** the first page header `<header>`.
